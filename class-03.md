**three topics are:**
1. list Html
2. Boxes CSS
3. Javascript

## list in Html
we can use many tags for the list as we learned before the order and unordered list, but now I read about the definition list which uses `<dl>` and inside this tag `<dt>`and `<dd>`. Also, I read about the **nested list**.

## Boxes CSS
you can change the dimensions of the box by using `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height`, `hidden` and `scroll`. Other important things are the `border`, `margin`, and `padding`. Some rules are using for borders like `border-color`, `border-width`, and `border-style`. Also, I read about `display`, `text-algin`, and `visibility`. In addition to this, I read about the image border.

### Javascript
The first discussion of how to write *truthy* and *falsy* value. We have many methods to do a loop like `for`, `while` and `do while`. We are using for loop to repeat a specific time, but we are using while to repeat things until the condition will be false. the difference between
a while loop and a do while
loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the
condition.
